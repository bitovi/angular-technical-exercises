# Technical Exercise Purpose

This repository is designed to evaluate component Architecture and how well
candidates structure reusable components.

The core skill sets to showcase:

1. Maintaining backwards compatibility.
2. Providing a good developer exercise and "escape hatches" to keep development unblocked.
3. Accessibility and Angular best practices.

# The Exercises

When solving technical tasks. Finding a solution is more important that
providing the "most correct" solution. Once a solution is found, please provide
considerations for improvements verbally.

All exercises are found in `src/app/exercises`. Follow the prompts and solve the
technical tasks as provided verbally.

# Important directories:

1. `src/app/exercises` - all exercises
2. `src/styles/_variables.scss` - style tokens for theme
